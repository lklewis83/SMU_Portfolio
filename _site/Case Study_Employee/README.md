This readme is to help you understand the code and important variables

Main Dataset			
Variable Name	Notes		
attrition	Data is being pulled from CaseStudy2-data.csv file		


70/30 Split Train/Test of the Data 			
Variable Name	Predictors		
train_income	70 percent of the data is split to the training dataset and used to "train" the classifcation models		
test_income	30 percent of the data is split to this data set to validate how well the models are tained based off the training dataset	
train_att	70 percent of the data is split to the training dataset and used to "train" the classifcation models
test_att	30 percent of the data is split to this data set to validate how well the models are tained based off the training dataset
